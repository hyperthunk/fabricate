A 'build tool' to facilitate better managing the process of 
software builds, releases, installations, deployments and configuration.

The Fabricate Tao:

* Plug & Play
* Don't reinvent the wheel
* Use "best of breed" tools as a default
* Providing a common infrastructure then get out of the way

Fabricate does

- help to build, release, install & deploy a wide range of technologies
- standardise configuration management in a way that makes sense for your project
- provide simple mechanisms for extensibility

Fabricate might

- be a pain to run on Microsoft Windows

Fabricate will not
